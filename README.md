# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository. Here, I store and organize my progress in learning and implementing various data structures and algorithms. Each subdirectory contains specific topics, detailed explanations, and relevant code files.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into major DSA categories, each with relevant subcategories:

* **[Arrays](./Arrays/README.md)**: This section contains exercises and code related to 1D and 2D arrays, and Array ADTs.
* **[Algorithms](./Algorithms/README.md)**: This section encompasses various algorithm types including sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, backtracking algorithms, and dynamic programming.
* **[Recursion](./Recursion/README.md)**: Here you can find exercises related to different types of recursion, such as head and tail recursion and recursion using stacks.
* **[Linked Lists](./Linked-Lists/README.md)**: This directory covers different types of linked lists, including singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
* **[Queue](./Queue/README.md)**: This section covers different types of queues, including simple and circular queues.
* **[Trees](./Trees/README.md)**: This section includes various types of trees and tree-related algorithms, such as Binary Search Trees, AVL trees, Red-Black Trees, and Tries.
* **[Hashing](./Hashing/README.md)**: This directory contains exercises related to different types of hashing techniques, such as chain, linear, and quadratic hashing.
* **[Others](./Others/README.md)**: This is a miscellaneous category for other data structures and algorithms not included in the above categories.

Each category has a README file that further describes the specific topics and exercises it contains.

## How to Use

To navigate through the repository, click on the links provided above or use the directory structure on Github. Each directory contains a `README.md` file that explains the specific exercises and topics that directory contains. Each exercise or topic typically has a corresponding code file where the actual implementation is stored.

## Future Updates

This repository is actively maintained and will be updated as I continue learning and practicing new data structures and algorithms. 

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my personal use, any and all suggestions for improvements or additions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
